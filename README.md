# Google Sheets Add-On

Börsdata Google Sheets Addon  is a plugin/addin you install to your Google Sheets account.  
When it's installed you get access to serveral new Excel functions to directly call the Börsdata API.  

You have access to all data from Börsdata API like Stockprices, reportdata and Kpis.  
To use the Google Sheets Addon   you need to be a PRO Börsdata member and having an API Key.  

Börsdata Google Sheets Addon  are an extension to Börsdata API.  
In the background the Addon is calling the API to get data and formats the data to fit into Google Sheets.  

It has the same limitations, like number of requests, as the normal API, so if you have many functions it can take some time to load all data.  
We are happy for all feedback on how to improve the API and the Google Sheets Addon.
